# Questions
- Columns L & M what is the orange text "Orange-w/ DXA" (I have a line that is also highlighted in blue, what does that mean?)
- Col D, what is Clinical F/U interval? (upvote! I had the same question, I think F/U might be followup, but what does it mean in terms of everything? days between appointments wouldn't make sense, but what else could it be a followup to?)
- Alcohol abuse: does "Otherandunspecifiedalcoholdependence,unspecifieddrinkingbehavior" mean they DO or DO NOT have an alcohol abuse issue?
	- Is 'Alcoholabuse,uncomplicated' mean they DO or DO NOT have an alcohol abuse issue?
	- Remission?
- FRS 10 year risk, can we say that <1 is neglible, AKA = 0
- is "Death[d from CT]" just how many days they died after the CT? 
- if [d from CT] is negative, does that mean that they got the CT before the event occurred?
- what do fx, hx, and dx mean?
