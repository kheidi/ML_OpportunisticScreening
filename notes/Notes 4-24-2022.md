# 4-24-2022 Work Session Notes
## To-do
### Stage 1
- Decide what to do with blanks/NaN
	- Remove participant if they have even 1 NaN (only 345/9223 have NaN's in CT data, less than 4% of data) If we have time we can try different method.
- Lit review on "metabolic age", ML methods that have been used in healthcare similar to this

### Stage 2
- Predicted age problem:
	- Run nearest neighbor
		- Y values is age "Your age "category" is the mean(age) of those around you"
	- Run linear regression
	- Validate by finding error from "perfect" people, compare error from both methods
- Predicted days till death:
	- Run ML (maybe nearest neighbor and linear regression again?) only on dead people, do K-fold validation to see accuracy. We aren't sure if this is a great idea so we can just do it, check the accuracy and see if it seems good or not. If bad, reevaluate.

### Stage 3
- Introduce other columns to methods to see if we can "improve" estimates
